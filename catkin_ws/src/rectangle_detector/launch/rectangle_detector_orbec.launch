        <!-- TUNING GUIDE:
            Run the node with a representative sample image, calibration depends heavily on the camera, but on the environment
            as well. The node publishes 3 images: lines, graph and rectangles, the expected behaviour is that the node detects
            most rectangles but without reaching max_num_trapezoids. Recommended tuning steps:

            1. Display the rgb image, identify rectangles and remember where they are.

            2. Display the lines image, if rectangle edges are not being detected, modify FLD parameters in rectangle_detector_node.hpp,
                if edges are detected but do not connect, increase elongation_factor and elongation_adder. Never use elongation params 
                lower than 1, if the elongation params are too high, false corners are prone to appear.
            
            3. Display the graph image, corners appear in white and lines in green, if there are missing edges increase whiteness_threshold,
                if there are too many lines, decrease it. If there are multiple detected points for a single corner, increase nms_threshold,
                nms will also reduce the number of lines. lineImg_drawing_width drastically affects the detector, it should be adjusted so
                that lines are not too thin or wide in the lines image, it only depends on the resolution of the camera.

            4. Display the rectangles image, rectangles appear as coloured in a grayscale version of the image. There are many parameters to
                finish configuring the detector:
                    - *area_factors: filter rectangles that aree too large or too small, they are factors of the total image area
                    - compactness: Polsby-Popper compactness, filters rectangles that are too long and thin
                    - length_diff: Compares the length of the longest and the shortest edge, filters rectangles that are closer to a triangle
                    - angle: Chechs that the angles of the trapezoid are close to 90ยบ, also check that at least one of the sides is horizontal
                             or vertical.
